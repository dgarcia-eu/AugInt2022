# The Question of Collective Emotions

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=720}

```
</center>
- **Collective emotions (von Scheve and Salmela, 2014):**   
Emotional states shared by a large amount of people at the same time
- **Collective emotions are complex behaviors:** Compared to individual emotions, they can last longer, be stronger, and change in quality  

[Collective Emotions. Amit Goldenberg, David Garcia, Eran Halperin, James Gross. Current Directions in Psychological Science (2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721420901574)

## The challenge of studying collective emotions

- Collective emotions are more challenging to study than individual emotions:
  - **Experimentation is not as simple:** need for group experiments rather than individual experiments
  - **Measurement is complicated:** need to measure many people together
    - Self-reports can disrupt the social interaction process
  - **Manipulation can be dangerous:** not just individual informed consent


- Social media offer a window to **observe** collective emotions
  - Large groups of people interacting *in vivo*
  - Natural exposure to the emotional expression of others
  - Long observation periods, additional metadata such as social links
  - However, methods are still young, samples are self-selected, experimentation is still very hard

## Detecting Individual Emotions in Social Media

## Challenges in individual emotion detection

**The problem with sentiment analysis: Writer versus reader emotions**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=950, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/communication.png")
```

Current sentiment analysis approaches assume that the **ground truth** is an annotation of emotions by **a reader**, often a student or a crowdsourcing worker

# Datasets summary

- Vent dataset samples:
![](figures/VentTests.png)

- Out-of-domain validation datasets:
<center> ![:scale 60%](figures/OOD.png) </center>

---

# Results in Vent

![](figures/VentResults.png)

- $F_1$ metric measures the quality of the prediction, from 0 (terrible) to 1 (perfect)
- LEIA outperforms supervised and unsupervised methods
- This performance is consistent across emotions
- Results generalize across users and time
---

# Out-of-domain results

![](figures/OODresults.png)

- LEIA is best or tied with the best in all out-of-domain tests
- LEIA is best or tied with the best in all emotions except Fear in TEC
- Performance is very high for two reference standards: enISEAR and SemEval
